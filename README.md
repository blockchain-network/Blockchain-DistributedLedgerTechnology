# Blockchain-DistributedLedgerTechnology

From this module, I have learn to explain the core concepts behind blockchain and distributed ledger. Through the use of blockchain, it ensure that data has high availability and resistant to tampering, making it well suited for use in cryptocurrencies. In addition, there are other areas where blockchain technology will be useful, for example, financial services, identity registers, asset registers and supply chain management.
